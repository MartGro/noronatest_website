# Why is testing important?
We want to push forward to stop the Corona virus by promoting rapid antigen tests both conducted as self-tests or in a centralized way. To effectively fight the epidemic everybody should get tested once a week. This way hotspots and clusters can be detected quickly and quarantine measures can be targeted more effectively.
Rapid tests are available in increasing numbers from multiple manufacturers. Nevertheless, the application of these tests lags behind.
Here we see great potential for our product. We want to enable people to make their latest test visible by a wearable NORONA tag. Our idea is that this tag is worn like a name badge, visibly indicating the time passed since the latest testing took place.
On one hand people can show that they are doing their part in the fight against Corona, on the other hand people know they are safer if many others wear such tags.
We aim to unify the fragmented market by providing one common indicator for all the different manufacturers of certified tests.
